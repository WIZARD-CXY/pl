stl map is using red-black tree for storing kv pairs, no need to handle collision, since it is a balanced bst.insert and lookup take O(logn) time while hash is taking O(1) time.

hash design pattern 
1 choose a hash function that is distributing keys evenly.
2 dynamicly scale the hash table size

use stl map or bst to replace the hash table if number of element is small
